              The goal of this project was quite simple: Challenging myself! But also, the idea of building a game like
              4 pics 1 word targeted at a more geeky and weebish players persisted somewhere in the back of my mind. It
              was the perfect opportunity to make it a reality!

              I had lots of fun (not always) building this project, although it is not 100% complete. I want to add more
              features as I get better at coding and players request more.
