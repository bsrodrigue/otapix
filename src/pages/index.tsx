              The goal of this project was quite simple: Challenging myself! But
              also, the idea of building a game like 4 pics 1 word targeted at a
              more geeky and weebish players persisted somewhere in the back of
              my mind. It was the perfect opportunity to make it a reality!

              I had lots of fun (not always) building this project, although it
              is not 100% complete. I want to add more features as I get better
              at coding and players request more.
