## Welcome

Otapix is a small web platform built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) and [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com) to allow users to create, manage and share otapix packs. An otapix pack is a collection of word or name guessing riddles, inspired from the famous [4Pics1Word](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4_Pics_1_Word) mobile game but with a more geeky and weeb-ish flavour. Keep in mind that the platform is just for managing and finding packs. The actual game is played on another website or client.

The goal is to provide geeks and anime fans with tools to create their own puzzles, share them and have fun together.
